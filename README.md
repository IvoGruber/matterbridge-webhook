---

Matterbridge webhook plugin creates matter devices for your webhooks. Thus you can trigger calling the webhook to start more complex automations in different environments from your matter controller.

This plugin is in early development stage and not all described features are yet available. It started as a fork from [Matterbridge dynamic platform example plugin](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-example-dynamic-platform)

The devices can be configured as light, switch or outlet. Switching them on triggers the webhook and the bridge will switch them off after a short period of time.

## Prerequisites
